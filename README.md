# Best-Flight-Path

The purpose of our project is to help Ben Sherman, a UK broker to determine flight paths based on his investment needs in various cities. Ben has already invested in a company in Kuala Lumpur and is now planning to travel to several other cities in Asia to expand his investment. The cities include Jakarta, Bangkok, Taipei, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul. Ben is a busy man, so he needs to save up as much time as possible in everything that he does. With so many cities to travel through, he needs to have an efficient travelling plan based on the distance of the cities from each other and from his starting point in Kuala Lumpur. Not only that, Ben also needs to consider the economic value of each city and the possible return of investment and factor that into his travel plan. It is a difficult and complicated task. 

This is where our project comes in. We have designed a program to help him plan out his travel path to be as efficient as possible. The program will not only calculate the distances between each of the cities that he will visit, it will also analyse the recent economic conditions there in order to determine the return of investment for him. Then, by factoring in both of the variables (distance and return of investment), this program will lay out an efficient travel plan for Ben to minimise time spent travelling and maximise the possibility of better return of investments.
